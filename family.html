                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <H3>What was my role in the project?</h3>
                <p>My role involved both the UX and UI stages in the design of the Family Friendly Cooking Web App.</p>
                <h3>How did I interpret the project brief?</h3>
                <p>The objective of the brief was to design a responsive web app for recipes that meet the needs of its
                   users and solve the problems they are facing with existing recipe apps. Through research <br>
                   and testing, I wanted to determine the pain points users experienced with current recipe apps. My job
                   was then to create a user experience that solved those problems and design a <br>
                   responsive web app that simplifies the lives of the users.</p>
                <h3>What roadblocks did I encounter as I worked on each deliverable? How did I overcome these
                    roadblocks?</h3>
                <p>I struggled the most with the overall design of Family Friendly Cooking. I wanted the color scheme,
                   icons, and imagery to be inviting to children and adults alike. It was important to find <br>
                   balance for the app to be family friendly since both families and individuals would be using the app.
                   This involved asking a lot of questions during testing about colors, patterns, and <br>
                   images and what worked best for each user.</p>
                <h3>What insights from my research and testing had the biggest impact on my final design?</h3>
                <p>During my research and testing, I found my users wanted an app that was easy to use, had a big
                   library, wanted to search by ingredient and cooking appliance, and wanted to see how a recipe <br>
                   was made. This is what inspired me to have not only the child-friendly noted directions, but video
                   demonstrations and utensil images as well. The testing stage highlighted navigational and <br>
                   design flaws which improved my eye for design and usability
                <p>
                <h3>Did I have to change direction at all?</h3>
                <p>The user testing opened my eyes to the importance of accessibility. The colors I chose did seem to do
                   well, but some of the shadows I used for the buttons were a bit excessive. I did end <br>
                   using more whitespace than what I originally thought was needed. I also did a lot of text rearranging
                   so that everything could fit on one screen to minimize scrolling.</p>
                <h3>Would I do anything different?</h3>
                <p>I believe that critiquing during the earlier stages would have been a huge help. I went back to
                   earlier design decisions several times. I should not be afraid to ask for testers review my <br>
                   work because the more testers that I have the more information I can get back. It will also give me
                   back up testers in case there are delays with any participants.</p>
                <h3>Extra insights</h3>
                <p>I enjoyed the whole process. Taking on both the UX and UI stages of the project enlightened me to the
                   importance of the whole team collaboration. I believe that if this project was <br>
                   completed within a team setting, the group support would have been valuable. I really look forward to
                   being among a team of creatives in the future.</p>
